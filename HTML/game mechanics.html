                </h2>

                <p>DOTO 2 is a combination of RTS including perspective and a heavy requirement of tactics and team co-ordination and RPG including itemization and leveling up. The main objective in DOTO 2 is to destroy the enemy Ancient Structure inside
                    their stronghold, these strongholds are protected by multiple towers down 3 lanes. The player controls a Hero which fights for them and gains strength by leveling up by getting experience, which is given when creeps and heroes die,
                    and by itemization by buying items with gold. Gold is gained passively over time, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes and buildings. You can prevent the enemy gaining as much gold and experience by denying creeps and buildings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Heroes are all unique characters within DOTO 2. At the start of each game, players are split into two teams of 5 versus 5 and then select a Hero from the Hero Pool. Every player controls his own Hero and any units that Hero controls. Heroes will gain
                    experience when enemy units are killed nearby. They start the game at level one, and as they earn experience, they eventually level up. Each level a Hero earns grants attributes and a skill point. Dota 2 currently has 20 playable heroes.
                    Heroes are split into 3 categories: strength, agility and intelligence.

                    Items are used to give heroes additional abilities, bonus stats or provide health or mana regeneration. Items are sold at the shop, side-lane shop or the secret shop. More powerful items require several base items to be created as well as a recipe. Items
                    take up space in the hero's inventory, courier's inventory, or stash, each of which have 6 slots.
